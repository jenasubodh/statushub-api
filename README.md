# StatusHub

A Realtime Status Sharing Application

## Commands

After you generate your project, these commands are available in `package.json`.

```bash
npm test # test using Jest
npm run test:unit # run unit tests
npm run test:integration # run integration tests
npm run coverage # test and open the coverage report in the browser
npm run lint # lint using ESLint
npm run dev # run the API in development mode
npm run prod # run the API in production mode
npm run docs # generate API docs
```

## Playing locally

First, you will need to install and run [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in another terminal instance.

```bash
$ mongod
```

Then, run the server in development mode.

```bash
$ npm run dev
Express server listening on http://0.0.0.0:9000, in development mode
```

## Directory structure

### src/api/

Here is where the API endpoints are defined. Each API has its own folder.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/model.js

It defines the Mongoose schema and model for the API endpoint. Any changes to the data model should be done here.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/controller.js

This is the API controller file. It defines the main router middlewares which use the API model.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/index.js

This is the entry file of the API. It defines the routes using, along other middlewares (like session, validation etc.), the middlewares defined in the `some-endpoint.controller.js` file.

### services/

Here you can put `helpers`, `libraries` and other types of modules which you want to use in your APIs.
